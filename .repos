# This poor mans associative array will be expanded to a `git clone` command.
# The key (before the `:`) will be used as the repo name:
# the value is the name of the local (sub) directory where the repo will be cloned
# The value should also be the 1-to-1 mapping of the service name in docker-compose.yml
#
# In pseudo code it would look like this:
# => "git clone git@github.com:Codaisseur/codaisseur-${key}.git ${value}"
